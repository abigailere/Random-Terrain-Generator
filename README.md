Random Terrain Generator is a customizable terrain generator that supports 4 different terrain types and real-time preview functionality. Spots are colored depending on how often that area is visited. A square is colored grey if the are is visited the most out of all possible steps, brown if next most, then green, then blue (blue being the least). The height map takes the same information and instead colors the squares in grey scale. Users can modify the dimensions to create a higher resolution image.
